# Junker PoS (Point of Sale) System

## About
Junker PoS is a point of sale system that was created to learn about utilizing Flask and Azure services.
It is also an experiment in scalability, I want to learn what it takes to scale architect a solution. I called it Junker cause its gonna be a mess in a good way nothing comes out perfect when you first make it. If you have any suggestions please shoot it my way, I am always open to feedback I can learn from! Thanks!

I am going to first start scaling from the needs of one store to a much larger organization.
